    <p>
      Ol√°! I&apos;m Elizabet, a Rapper and Award Winner Design Engineer from
      Portugal, daughter of Portuguese and Mozambican parents. I was the first
      female solo rapper to sign with a major label in Portugal. I lived in
      Dublin for four years, which gave me a ton of stories and a taste for
      Guinness! I speak at tech conferences around the world, sharing my
      insights and passion. Currently, I work as a Staff Design Engineer at
      Xata, a San Francisco based company led by an inspiring female CEO. I love
      both music and technology, and I&apos;m especially passionate about
      combining the two to create innovative and exciting experiences.
